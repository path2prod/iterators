# Understanding Basic

1. Create a simple ArrayList of integers and use an Iterator to print all elements
2. Implement the same using enhanced for-loop and explain the connection to Iterable
3. Create a List of strings and remove all strings that start with a specific letter using Iterator.remove()
4. Compare this with attempting removal during enhanced for-loop (demonstrate ConcurrentModificationException)
5. Create a class NumberRange that implements Iterable<Integer>
6. Use ListIterator to traverse a list both forward and backward
7. Create a generic class `ArrayWrapper<T>` that wraps a regular array, implement Iterable<T> to make it work with enhanced for-loops and support both forward iteration and index-based access
8. Create a class `EvenNumbersIterable` that iterates only even numbers within a given range
9. Create a class `StringIterable` that implements Iterable<Character> for a given string, allowing iteration over each character in the string
 and adding option to skip whitespace characters.
