Repo to help mastering iterators. It's split in multiple sections to deal with different challenges. 
Each section has its own path with 2 folders:

* `tdd` contains tests to be completed and minimum compilation set up. This approach follows TDD therefore none test must pass
* `complete` contains full code for further assistance, every test pass.

The purpose of this repo is not to complete every challenge, as nowadays any AI is able to do it in a blink. I'm playing with them to:
* Better understand iterators


## Notes
* Disabling Copilot autocomplete is recommended.
* Test classes must not changed
* On a test file replace `tdd` import with `complete` to run original tests
* Install jdk23
* Enable preview to run individual tests on your IDE. `Build.gradle` already contains it although this only works when tests are delegated to Gradle
